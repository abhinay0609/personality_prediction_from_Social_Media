so there was nothing to vanish just personal taste and me not liking it  the guy i kissed didnt know me it was one of thosesounds pretty much like my area and what im going through right now trying to figure out which way i want to take my life i want to do so many things the biggest problem is that i know if i dontd i was operating under the impression that you were female i never looked at your

one one around only dull woods if i was a serial killer this would be the perfect place but sadly imtbh and biased sounds like a shadowed infp i think maybe he was hurt and turned estj i can tell because he has some of the typical infp traits left overchecks list im sorry it seems that you have came at a bad time weve already reached our quota of infjs however being youre female and i like females i will make you a deal i will kick oneim antp leaning toward e im easy for both entps and intps to identify with i also imagine entps interrogations would go a little bit like jacks from 24 except more mechanical rigging up shock treatment equipment in an abandoned building out of an old car batty jumperit was a compliment  trust me im just as psychopathic d except i have emoticons theyre just weird ones like laughing when i get hurt or at people running themselves over with their lawn mower  its like a theme for where i live and that is why i know it by heart    i usual dont
