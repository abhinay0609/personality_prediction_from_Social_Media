one one around only dull woods if i was a serial killer this would be the perfect place but sadly imtbh and biased sounds like a shadowed infp i think maybe he was hurt and turned estj i can tell because he has some of the typical infp traits left overchecks list im sorry it seems that you have came at a bad time weve already reached our quota of infjs however being youre female and i like females i will make you a deal i will kick oneim antp leaning toward e im easy for both entps and intps to identify with i also imagine entps interrogations would go a little bit like jacks from 24 except more mechanical rigging up shock treatment equipment in an abandoned building out of an old car batty jumperit was a compliment  trust me im just as psychopathic d except i have emoticons theyre just weird ones like laughing when i get hurt or at people running themselves over with their lawn mower  its like a theme for where i live and that is why i know it by heart    i usual dont

really likes patting and hugs onlywell kind of as it was already mentioned sometimes because of ni its hard to convey complex stuff which pops up in your head in whimsical compilations of shapes and pictures only with wordsi think this kitten would be very appropriate here  376562367034good night everyone out there even if for someone there is morning right now  nights always supersede mornings and people say good night in order to meet next day oh that movie  its awesome thank you hope you had good sleep in the air anyway im wishing you good night for the next night ahead hopefully it will be on land  good people deserve good358882  358890well other people who may be wondering about an issue from the name of the topic will find your response helpful anyway this finally someone mentioned that i still see creaturesfaces in a maze of various random patterns it can be amusing sometimes  its a very handy skill when youre boredoh i didnt know that what a pity  why not sacrifice whole supermarket then we can decide which walmart will be the best i think the biggest one would be greatyippy  here you go  357002  he thinks that the fire is delicious should i sacrifice tofu i dont like to waste foodi dont think that the creator of this thread cares whats going on here after 3 years heh i understand you  with these same given languagesyessss adventure time di get angry quite rarely but when i do its safer for surrounding people to go somewhere else its impossible for me to hide or suppress anger the only way to get rid of this feeling is to burstive never liked it  anything fake is bad actuallyhugs should be given only to chosen ones chosen there are quite few of them though349890yup youre doing it right  course its not very comfortable  but human race survived thankfully womens ability to give birth to other human beings it worked for thousands of years why change it besides there arethat happens and it occurs because most often people use results of extremely precise
